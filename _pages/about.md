I'm a PhD candidate in Biostatistics at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine where I am advised by Dr. Nandita Mitra. My main research interests are applications and methods development for causal inference, health policy, cancer outcomes, and comparative effectiveness studies. Previously, I worked as a Software Engineer and Associate Data Scientist at AppNexus (Xandr) after earning by B.S. in Applied Math and Computer Science from Brown University.

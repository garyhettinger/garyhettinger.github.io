I am an incoming Assistant Professor of Biostatistics in the Department of Population Health at the New York University Grossman School of Medicine. My doctoral training was conducted in Biostatistics at the University of Pennsylvania's Perelman School of Medicine, where I was advised by Dr. Nandita Mitra. My research focuses on developing and applying statistical methodology for causal inference, health policy, cancer outcomes, and comparative effectiveness studies. Before pursuing my PhD, I worked as a Software Engineer and Associate Data Scientist at AppNexus (Xandr) and earned my B.S. in Applied Mathematics and Computer Science from Brown University.

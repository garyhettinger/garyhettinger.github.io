I am a PhD candidate in Biostatistics at the University of Pennsylvania's Perelman School of Medicine, where I am advised by Dr. Nandita Mitra. My research focuses on developing and applying statistical methodology for causal inference, health policy, cancer outcomes, and comparative effectiveness studies. Before pursuing my PhD, I worked as a Software Engineer and Associate Data Scientist at AppNexus (Xandr) and earned my B.S. in Applied Mathematics and Computer Science from Brown University.
